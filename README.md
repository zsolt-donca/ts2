# ts2
A toy project to exercise using the Eff monad for pure functional programming.

Using [typelevel/cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) and [atnos-org/eff](https://github.com/atnos-org/eff). Also using parts of the lightbend stack.

## WARNING

The code is very experimental. It was mostly concieved as a training ground / sandbox for playing for the first time with _eff monads_ and thus it is **very rough**.
